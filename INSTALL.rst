Installation
============

Should be a simple as cloning this repository, then running ``pip install .`` inside this directory, preferably in a fresh virtual environment.

To use CASTEP, the desired binary should be found on your ``$PATH`` as ``castep``, or specified in the initialisation script. The ``voronoi_shuffle`` mutation currently requires some closed source code, unfortunately :(
