# **ilustrado**

ilustrado is a simple genetic algorithm created to run primarily on results from incomplete random structure searches.

The main use case is for situations where the search space is prohibitively large to assure sufficient sampling. ilustrado makes extensive use of the [matador](https://bitbucket.org/me388/matador) API.
